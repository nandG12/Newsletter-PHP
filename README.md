## Description of Task
To Send the Random XKCD Comics, I have created a function that fetches the Random XKCD Comic from https://xkcd.com/{RandomNumber}/info.0.json. A GET request is made in which the comic data is returned in the JSON Format for that particular comic. Then the Necessary Data will be used after decoding the JSON Format. This data will used to show the comic on the Website or Sent to the user's email ID.

Send Mail (comic_mail.php) Script contains the id & password without that any user can't access or run that Mail Script/Page. For sending the comic into email at a specific time interval, Task Scheduler/Cron Job will use this. To Deploy the Website I have used the Heroku Platform. For the Cron/Task Scheduler We can use their add-ons (Heroku Scheduler). We can do it in a local machine or any third party Website that allows to create the Cron Job.
